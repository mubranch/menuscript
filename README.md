## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

MenuScript is uses rumps, tkinter, and subprocess to run any script from the menubar. If your script needs a virtual environment, you can specify the path to the virtual environment in the config file and then
run the script as if it were in the virtual environment.

This project is really just a passion project that makes it easier for me to run my common scripts without opening the terminal. I hope you find it useful as well.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. Simply head to the releases page and download the latest release. Put it in your Applications folder and run it just like you would any other MacOS application. 

If Scripts are failing to run, make sure you given menuscript the correct permissions. You can do this by going to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility and adding menuscript to the list of applications that can control your computer.

The code is pretty simple and you can easily modify it to fit your needs. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

### Prerequisites

Must have python3 installed.

### Installing

```
Step 1: Download the latest release from the releases folder.
```

```
Step 2: Put the application in your Applications folder.

```

```

Step 3: Run the application. If you want menuscript to run on startup, you can add it to your login items in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items.
