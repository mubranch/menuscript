# Hi, this is your configuration file. This is a scalable way to add scripts to the menubar app.
# To successfully execute scripts, MenuScript needs to know 3 things about your script: 
# 1. The name (this can be anything)
# 2. The location of the script file (example: 'main.py')
# 3. The location of the executable which runs your script (typically ends with ...venv/bin/python)
#
# For an actual tutorial, head to the docs at https://www.someurl.com
#
# Example correctly entered script, feel free to copy paste and insert your name and paths.
