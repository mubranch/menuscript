# Hi, this is your configuration file. This is a scalable way to add scripts to the menubar app.
# To successfully execute scripts, MenuScript needs to know 3 things about your script: 
# 1. The name
# 2. The location
# 3. The location of the executable which runs your script
#
# For an actual tutorial, head to the docs at https://www.someurl.com
#
# Example correctly entered script, feel free to copy paste and insert your name and paths.
#
# (name)[Hello World] (script)[test_script/main.py] (venv)[None]

(name)[Test Script] (script)[./src/resources/data/test_script/main.py] (venv)[None]
